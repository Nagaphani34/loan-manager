. Technology Stack:
Backend:

Node.js with TypeScript
Express.js (optional, for API handling)
Database: MongoDB (or any suitable database of your choice)
Frontend (Dashboard):

React.js or any preferred frontend framework (for the purpose of integrating with the backend)
2. Functional Requirements:
Form Integration:

The application form should be connected to the backend to accept inputs from users.
Users should be able to submit application forms that will store their data in the backend.
Dashboard:

The dashboard should reflect accurate statistics based on the submitted data.
Ensure the data in the dashboard updates dynamically as users submit their application forms.
User Inputs:

Handle multiple users' inputs efficiently and ensure that the data is stored properly in the database.
Design the backend in a way that ensures each userâ€™s data is unique and retrievable.
Statistics:

The dashboard should calculate and display statistics such as total applications, average loan amount, application success rate, etc., in real-time.
Align these statistics with the Figma design.
3. Design Adjustment:
You may make adjustments to the Figma design to improve functionality but no need to design the graphs.
The focus should be on backend development while integrating the form with the dashboard.
Deliverables:
1. GitHub Repository Link:
Create a GitHub repository to store your code.
Make sure the repository is well-organized, with clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
Include a README.md file that explains the project structure, how to install dependencies, and how to run the application.
2. Video Demonstration:
Provide a screen recording (video) demonstrating the functionality of the module. The video should include:

The process of submitting an application through the form.
How the data is reflected in the dashboard.
Display any statistics generated by the backend in the dashboard.
3. Live Project Link:
Deploy the project and provide a live link to your project so that the reviewers can test the functionality in real-time.

You can use platforms like Heroku, Vercel, Netlify, or any cloud hosting service of your choice for deployment.
Steps to Follow:
1. Backend Development:
Set up a Node.js project with TypeScript.

Create REST API endpoints for:

POST to submit data from the form.
GET to retrieve statistics for the dashboard.
2. Database:
Set up a database to store application form data.

Use MongoDB or any database of your choice.
Design appropriate models to store user application details.
Ensure data validation (e.g., required fields, proper formats) for each field in the form.
3. Form and Dashboard Integration:
Integrate the frontend form with the backend API to handle form submissions.
Ensure the dashboard fetches data from the backend to calculate and display statistics dynamically.
4. Test and Debug:
Test the form submission process to ensure data is being correctly saved in the database.
Verify that the dashboard reflects correct and up-to-date statistics based on the submitted data.
5. Documentation:
Document the setup process and any assumptions or modifications made during the development.
Evaluation Criteria:
Backend Functionality: Proper integration of the form with the backend. Ensuring data is stored and retrieved correctly.
Frontend Integration: Ensuring the dashboard displays the statistics accurately and updates dynamically.
Code Structure and Cleanliness: Well-organized code with clear comments and documentation.
Deployment: A working live version of the application with the provided URL.
Video Demonstration: Clear demonstration of the functionality.
